Can be solved by looking at how many corners are covered, which is smart but because it's only one test case it probably ins't worth solving. Here is the usaco.guide solution
```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <cstdio>

using namespace std;

bool covered(int x, int y, int x1, int y1, int x2, int y2) {
	/*
	 * returns true if (x, y) is covered by the rectangle bounded by
	 * (x1, y1) and (x2, y2) and false otherwise
	 */
	return x >= x1 && x <= x2 && y >= y1 && y <= y2;
}

int main() {
	freopen("billboard.in","r",stdin);
	freopen("billboard.out","w",stdout);

	int x1, y1, x2, y2;
	cin >> x1 >> y1 >> x2 >> y2;
	int x3, y3, x4, y4;
	cin >> x3 >> y3 >> x4 >> y4;

	// count how many corners of the billboard are covered
	int corner_num = 0;
	if (covered(x1, y1, x3, y3, x4, y4)) corner_num++;
	if (covered(x1, y2, x3, y3, x4, y4)) corner_num++;
	if (covered(x2, y1, x3, y3, x4, y4)) corner_num++;
	if (covered(x2, y2, x3, y3, x4, y4)) corner_num++;

	// if fewer than 2 corners are covered, the whole rectangle must be covered
	if (corner_num < 2) {
		cout << (x2 - x1) * (y2 - y1);
	} else if (corner_num == 4) {
		// if all 4 corners are covered, then nothing needs to be covered
		cout << 0;
	} else {
		// we only need to cover some portion of the rectangle
		// find the intersection of the two rectangles
		int xl = max(x1, x3);
		int xr = min(x2, x4);
		int yl = max(y1, y3);
		int yr = min(y2, y4);
		// subtract away the area of the intersection
		cout << (x2 - x1) * (y2 - y1) - (xr - xl) * (yr - yl);
	}
}
```
